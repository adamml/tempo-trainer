# Tempo Trainer
A data field for Garmin devices which allows for training to a tempo

## Installing
Download the data field from the Garmin Connect store and add it to the activity types you wish to use it for.

## Operating modes
The data field can operate either in an interval mode (1 second to 9 minutes 59 seconds), or in beats per minute mode (10 to 60 beats per minute).

An alert is given when the metronome clicks over, and this can be set to tone; tone and vibrate; vibrate; or visual only. In Beats per Minute mode, or for intervals shorter than 30 seconds, a single audible beep and single vibration are given. For longer intervals, a longer tone is played and a three-pulse vibration pattern is introduced.

The data field visuals assume a 4:4 time and repeat through the following pattern:
